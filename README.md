# The Shoppies

## Project Description

The Shoppies is a movie nomination application created as part of the application process for the Shopify Fall 2021 Frontend Developer Internship. This app allows users to search for films and save their favorite films that they feel should be up for nomination. When they have selected 5 nominees, they should be notified that they are finished.

## The Challenge

Create a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

* Search OMDB's API and display the results (movies only)
* Add a movie from the search results to the nomination list
*	View the list of films already nominated
*	Remove a nominee from the nomination list
*	Each search result should list at least its title, year of release, and a button to nominate that film
*	Updates to the search terms should update the result list
*	If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button
*	Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations

### Extras
